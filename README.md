# Python String Formatting with `format` Method

The `format` method in Python is a powerful tool for string formatting. It allows you to create formatted strings by embedding placeholders within a string and then replacing those placeholders with values. The `format` method can handle a wide range of formatting tasks, including number formatting, alignment, padding, and more.

## How `format` Works

The `format` method works by using a format string that contains placeholders enclosed in curly braces `{}`. These placeholders can include optional format specifications that control how the values are formatted. The values to be formatted are passed as arguments to the `format` method.

## Example Code

```python
num = 1000000
formatted_num = "{:,}".format(num)
print(formatted_num)  # Output: "1,000,000"

formatted_num_with_spaces = formatted_num.replace(",", " ")
print(formatted_num_with_spaces)  # Output: "1 000 000"
```

### Detailed Explanation

#### Placeholder and Format Specification

In this example, the format string `"{:,}"` contains a single placeholder `{: ,}`. The colon `:` inside the placeholder indicates that a format specification follows. The comma `,` is the format specification that tells Python to use commas as thousand separators.

#### Formatting the Number

When the `format` method is called with the value `num`, it replaces the placeholder `{: ,}` with the formatted value of `num`. The format specification `,` ensures that commas are used as thousand separators. So, `1000000` is formatted as `"1,000,000"`.

#### Replacing Commas with Spaces

After formatting the number with commas, the `replace` method is used to replace all commas with spaces. This changes the formatted string from `"1,000,000"` to `"1 000 000"`.

## Format Specification Mini-Language

The format specification mini-language is a set of rules that define how values should be formatted. Here are some common format specifications:

### Comma as Thousand Separator

```python
"{:,}".format(1000000)  # Output: "1,000,000"
```

The comma `,` is used to insert commas as thousand separators.

### Fixed-Point Number

```python
"{:.2f}".format(1234.5678)  # Output: "1234.57"
```

The `.2f` format specification rounds the number to 2 decimal places.

### Percentage

```python
"{:.2%}".format(0.1234)  # Output: "12.34%"
```

The `.2%` format specification converts the number to a percentage with 2 decimal places.

### Alignment and Padding

```python
"{:<10}".format("test")  # Output: "test      "
```

The `<10` format specification left-aligns the text within a field of width 10.

## Customizing Format Specifications

You can combine multiple format specifications to achieve the desired formatting. For example:

### Combining Thousand Separator and Fixed-Point

```python
"{:,.2f}".format(1234567.89)  # Output: "1,234,567.89"
```

This combines the comma as a thousand separator and rounds the number to 2 decimal places.

## Summary

The `format` method in Python is a versatile tool for string formatting. By using placeholders and format specifications, you can control how values are formatted and displayed. In the provided code snippet, the format specification `,` is used to insert commas as thousand separators, and the `replace` method is used to replace those commas with spaces. This approach enhances the readability of large numbers by using spaces instead of commas to separate thousands.
